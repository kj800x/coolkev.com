        <h1> Work + Projects </h1>
        <p> Many of my projects combine my love of programming, web development, and sound engineering: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> I'm currently studying at Northeastern University for a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Music Recording. </li>
          <li> I'm currently on co-op as a software developer at Hubspot. </li>
          <li> I'm available to run sound and lighting tech for events around Boston </li>
          <li> I'm developing a lightweight wireless theatrical light control system, LightMate. More information on it can be found at the <a href="http://www.redmondtheatretech.com/LightMate.html">LightMate homepage</a>.</li>
          <li> I've also written a program designed for playing sound effects in the theatre (requiring instant playback). Available at <a href="https://github.com/kj800x/SyncedPlay_Java">GitHub</a>.</li>
          <li> I was the bass in <a href="http://twitter.com/NL_ACappella">Northern Lights</a>, the co-ed auditioned A Cappella group at my high school. </li>
          <li> I return to my high school to run sound and lighting tech for events. </li>
        </ul>

      <div id="webtoys" class="contentdiv">
        <h1> Web Toys </h1>
        <p> Here are some of my simple one-off projects: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> I wrote a tool to decode DNA for my bio class. (<a href="./prototype/WebToys/DNA/index.html">link here</a>).</li>
          <li> I wrote a tool to do dimensional analysis for my chem class. (<a href="./prototype/WebToys/Dimensional_Analysis/index.html">link here</a>).</li>
          <li> I wrote an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm back in high school. (<a href="./prototype/WebToys/Dijkstra/index.html">link here</a>).</li>
          <li> I wrote a tool to help with balancing chemical equations. (<a href="./prototype/WebToys/EquationBalancer/index.html">link here</a>).</li>
          <li> I wrote a timer for the bells at my high school. They've since changed the times, but I've graduated so it doesn't matter. It once was accurate. (<a href="./prototype/WebToys/belltimer/index.html">link here</a>).</li>
          <li> I wrote a game, but it's broken right now. (<a href="./prototype/WebToys/Game/index.html">link here</a>).</li>
        </ul>
