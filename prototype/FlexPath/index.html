	<p class="title"> LightMate </p>
<p>I've developed a wireless theatrical light control system, which is lightweight, mobile and wireless. Other light control systems are big, heavy and need a physical data cable running to them.  Using the websockets protocol, I wrote a program for the web browser to control lights on a node.js server. The server passes this data on to a custom circuit board that I made which translates the data into the DMX protocol that controls the lights.<p>
<p>Using a 3D modeling software, Blender, I was able to create a simulation of a theater stage. I programmed it to talk to the node.js server so it was able to accept DMX commands just like real stage lights would, allowing users to design their light show even when away from the stage.</p>
<p>In order to pull the whole product together, I had to decide on which hardware to run it on. I settled on the BeagleBoard Black because it has enough processing power to do whatever I wanted it to do, but was still small and inexpensive. I built a custom circuit board that took a signal from the BeagleBoard Black, turned it into DMX, and sent it out to the lights. After connecting all the pieces and adding a small Wi-Fi dongle, I had a system that was mobile, light and best of all, working!</p>
<p>The wireless idea was an excellent addition to the concept. Previously light board operators were fixed in one place. They had a heavy light board that was big, and a data cable had to run to them to allow them to communicate with the lights. My board broadcasts a wireless network, which the operator can connect to from anywhere in the theater with any web browser of their choosing to control the lights.</p>
<p>The final step in preparing my product was to create a plastic enclosure to protect it. I had no experience in machining, so I recruited the aid of my school's engineering teacher to help me design the spec sheets and drill out the holes in the plastic. </p>
<p>An ability that I have planned for the node.js server is the ability to store arbitrary data on the network. This opens my project to a slew of modifications. For example, a webcam could detect what part of the stage an actor is standing in and pass that data to the web application. A custom plugin on the web application could detect that data and turn on the appropriate lights. Similar setups could be used to activate lights when a motion sensor is activated. The possibilities are endless.</p>

	<p class="caption">Through it's development cycle, the software has grown from a very simple "hacked together" prototype to a fully featured product.</p>
	<img src="./v0.1.png">
	<p class="caption">The first version was very basic. The user interface was unpleasant to look at, and it didn't simplify the lights at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="group">
	<img src="./v0.2.png">
	<p class="caption">The second version was a big improvement upon the first. Each light's address was displayed in the software, so you no longer were guessing what would happen when you moved a slider.</p>
</div>
<div class="group">
	<img src="./v0.8.png">
	<p class="caption">A giant rewrite of the code took place, and the next version was built with organization of the data structures in mind. This allowed me to add numerous features, like transitions, cues, and effects that brought the code to a similar level as competing products. This allowed the user interface to look much better.</p>
</div>
<div class="group">
	<img src="./v1.1.png">
	<p class="caption">The current version fixed one last lingering issue. Each channel was now mapped to exactly one light, and all properties of that light (intensity, power state, color) were available through the palette. I also turned to a black color scheme, as you want to keep it dark in a theatre.</p>
